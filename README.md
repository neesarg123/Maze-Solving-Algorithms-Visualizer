# Searching Algorithms Maze Solutions VISUALIZER
Using pygame, I made this breadth frist search and depth-first search algorithms visualizer which I use to solve a maze which can be set up totally how you choose using your mouse. I was inspired to do this project by Tech With Tim's recent video in which he suggests project ideas to create during this unfortunate quarantine period.
