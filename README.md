# neesarg123 - Breadth First Search Maze Solution VISUALIZER
Using pygame, I made this breadth frist search algorithm visualizer which I use to solve a maze which can be set up totally how you choose using your mouse. I was inspired to do this project by Tech With Tim's recent video in which he suggests project ideas to create during this unfortunate quarantine period.

Furthermore, I found the following video really helpful to gain an intuition of the breadth first search alogrithm in contexts of solving mazes.
